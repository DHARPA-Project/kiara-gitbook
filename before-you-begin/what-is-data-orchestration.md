# What is data orchestration?

Data orchestration is the process of managing and conducting data-related tasks. In the context of kiara, data orchestration refers to how the software helps you organize, transform, and track your research data throughout the analytical process.

### From Sources to Data

Historical sources don't arrive as neatly structured data. Letters, census records, newspapers, and other primary sources must be transformed into machine-readable formats before computational analysis becomes possible. This transformation process involves critical decisions that shape your research outcomes â€“ yet many digital tools obscure the transformations they perform. When you simply click through software interfaces, you may lose sight of how your sources become data, how that data is manipulated, and ultimately how your interpretations relate to the original materials.

### Data Orchestration, documented

Kiara therefore allows you to both perform and track each of those steps. Rather than processing your data through monolithic "black box" tools, kiara facilitates the creation of data pipelines that consist of distinct, interconnected modules. Each module has clearly defined inputs, outputs, and processes, allowing you to understand exactly what happens to your data at each step. At the same time, kiara automatically tracks the ancestry of your data through every transformation. At any point, you can see exactly how a particular dataset was created, including all the inputs and processes involved, making your workflow and findings both explainable and reproducible.
