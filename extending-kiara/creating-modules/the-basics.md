# Writing your own kiara module - the basics

## Preparation

### Setting up development tools

To get going, we need a Python virtual environment in which to develop. We'll be using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) here, but this will work for 'normal' virtual (or conda-) environments as well,
so if you have a preferred way of working with Python, just do what you're used to.

As a first step, [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (if you haven't already).

After this, you can already run the `kiara` command in a temporary virtual uv environment:

```
uvx run kiara module list
```

### Creating a kiara plugin project

For this tutorial, we'll use a [project template](https://github.com/DHARPA-Project/kiara_plugin_template) to create a bare-bones kiara plugin project, 
which we will augment with our own module(s).

We can use kiara itself to create a project skeleton from a template:

```
uvx run kiara plugin create my_kiara_module
```

Answer the questions that are asked, something like:

```
You are about to create a new `kiara` plugin.

You'll be asked a series of questions; the answers will be used to prepare
a basic, pre-configured Python project.

For more information, visit:

https://github.com/DHARPA-Project/kiara_plugin_template

ðŸŽ¤ Your full name.
   Markus Binsteiner
ðŸŽ¤ Your email address.
   markus@frkl.dev
ðŸŽ¤ A short description of the plugin.
   A plugin tutorial.
ðŸŽ¤ Your github username or organization.
   DHARPA-Project
ðŸŽ¤ Your anaconda username or organization (optional).
   dharpa
```

This should have created a new folder, named `kiara_plugin.my_kiara_module`, initialized a git repository, and added
the first `initial` commit. Read the instructions in the command output to connect the project to your Github account,
but for our purposes that is not necessary here.

What we will do is try out whether the project is set up correctly, we can run the `kiara` command, and it picks up
the one example module in the project

```
cd kiara_plugin.my_kiara_module
uv run kiara module list my_kiara_module

```

Once this is done, you should see a module called `my_kiara_module.example`:

This module comes as example code with the project template, and is located in the `src/kiara_plugin/my_kiara_module/modules/__init__.py` Python file. 
It only serves as an example and blueprint for your own modules, and you can delete the module class within the file if you wish.

### Pre-loading a table dataset

In our tutorial we'll create a module to filter a table. In order to do this we'll need to pre-seed our kiara data store with a tabular dataset. 
Let's download some data into the `examples/data` folder,
which wen can then later re-use for tests and example jobs:

```
wget -o examples/data/JournalEdges1902.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHARPA-Project/kiara.examples/refs/heads/main/examples/data/journals/JournalEdges1902.csv
wget -o examples/data/JournalNodes1902.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHARPA-Project/kiara.examples/refs/heads/main/examples/data/journals/JournalNodes1902.csv
```

Then import the csv into a kiara `table` value. Here is the command to run (with the project root as our working directory):

```
uv run kiara run --save table=journal_nodes_table import.table.from.local_file_path path=examples/data/journals/JournalNodes1902.csv
```

This should have created an item with alias `journal_nodes_table` in the kiara data store, which you can confirm with `kiara data list`.

## Writing the kiara module

Ok, let's get started and create a kiara module that filters a table, using different filter criteria.

### Module skeleton

In most cases you'd delete the example module mentioned above, and create your module in the Python file where the example module was, or in a new Python file in the "modules" folder. 
For the purpose of this tutorial, we can just leave the example module in place, because it can serve as a quick reference for our own module. 
Use the editor of your choice, and paste the following text below the existing code into `modules/__init__.py`:

```python
from kiara import KiaraModule

class TutorialModule(KiaraModule):

    def create_inputs_schema(self):
        return {
            "table_input": {
                "type": "table"
            }
        }

    def create_outputs_schema(self):
        return {
            "table_output": {
                "type": "table"
            }
        }

    def process(self, inputs, outputs) -> None:
        pass
```

This module skeleton describes a kiara module that takes a dataset of type `table` as input (using `table_input` as input field name), and produces another table dataset as output 
(accordingly, using `table_output` as output field name). For your own modules, you'd probably use the field name `table` for both input and outputs, 
but in this tutorial we'll use the longer forms, to avoid any confusion.

On the next kiara run, the new module should be picked up by the `operation list` command:

```
uv run kiara operation list tutorial_module
```


The id of the module was autogenerated from the full Python path of its class: `kiara_plugin.my_kiara_module.my_kiara_module.tutorial_module`.

### Module id and description

In most cases, we don't want such a long and unwieldy module name. We can assign our own, custom and meaningful id by setting the `_module_type_name` class attribute. 
In addition, we will want to add some documentation about the module and its functionality that is displayed to the user. 
For this, we use a normal Python doc string on the Python class body. For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll only add a single sentence, 
but in most cases you'll want to have a multi-paragraph markdown text here. So, taking all that into account, edit the module code to include:

```python
...
...
class TutorialModule(KiaraModule):
    """Filter a table."""

    _module_type_name = "filter.table"

    def create_inputs_schema(self):
        return {
...
...
```

The output for our new module in the operation list is much prettier now:

```
uv run kiara operation list filter
```

We can also let kiara tell us about what it knows about the operation itself:

```
uv run kiara operation explain filter.table
```

### Input/output field documentation

As you can see in the `explain` output above, the information to the user is still a bit sparse. In most cases, we'll want to have some information about the input(s) the user is supposed 
to provide. Same for what the outputs actually mean. In both cases, we can add a `doc` attribute to each input and output field.

```python
    ...
    ...
    def create_inputs_schema(self):
        return {
            "table_input": {
                "type": "table",
                "doc": "The table to filter."
            }
        }

    def create_outputs_schema(self):
        return {
            "table_output": {
                "type": "table",
                "doc": "The filtered table."
            }
        }
    ...
    ...
```

Run the `explain` command again, to check what kiara thinks of our module now:

```
uv run kiara operation explain filter.table
```


### Processing the inputs

Specifying the inputs (and outputs) is an important part of designing your module, it's basically the module's 'public API', and you want to avoid changing it (too much; or at all) 
as your module evolves over time. But of course, the actual processing is where the interesting stuff happens. In kiara, that is the `process` method of every module. 
The arguments to this method are called `inputs` and `outputs`, which are basically dicts that use the field names specified in the `create_inputs_schema` / `create_outputs_schema` as keys, 
and Python objects of class [Value][kiara.models.values.value.Value] as values.

One thing to understand is that a `Value` object is not the same as the actual data. Instead, it's a reference to it (a means to retrieve it), and it also contains metadata 
about its provenance (pedigree/lineage) and other properties.

This is the signature of the `process` method, including type hints (which we will omit after this):

```python
from kiara.models.values.value import ValueMap, ValueMapWritable

    def process(inputs: ValueMap, outputs: ValueMapWritable):
        ...
        ...
```

The `inputs` and `outputs` arguments to the `process` method are of type [ValueMap][kiara.models.values.value.ValueMap]; the two main methods to access input data are:

- `inputs.get_value_obj([field_name])`: retrieve the (wrapper) `Value` object for a field
- `inputs.get_value_data([field_name])`: retrieve the data object for a field

In addition, you can retrieve the data object via the value wrapper:

```python
value = inputs.get_value_obj("field_name")
data = value.data
```
The class/type of the data depends on the data type of the value, so you'll have to consult the documentation about what to expect.

The important methods to set an output is:

- `outputs.set_value(field_name, result_data)`: set a single output field
- `outputs.set_values(field_name_1=result_data_1, field_name_2=result_data_2, ...)`: set multiple result values at once

All that out of the way, let's get started implementing our table filter. We'll do it in stages, so hopefully we can cover all the important aspects in this tutorial in a 
way that makes intuitive sense.

To that end, let's write some code that does ...nothing. Our first iteration of our module will take the input table, and immediately set it as output:

```python
def process(self, inputs, outputs):

    table_obj = inputs.get_value_obj("table_input")

    # some debug output is usually useful while developing. Something like:
    print(f"Filter module, table input: {table_obj}")
    print("Table data:")
    print(table_obj.data)

    outputs.set_value("table_output", table_obj)
```

If we `run` our module in this state, we should see our debug output, as well as the resulting table (which will be the unmodified input):

```
uv run kiara run filter.table table_input=alias:journal_nodes_table
```

Now it's time to drill a bit deeper into our input table, and figure out how to access the information it contains. 
kiara wraps data that shares some schema/structure into so-called 'data types'. You can access a list of the data types that are available in your current 
kiara environment with the `data-type list` sub-command:

```
uv run kiara data-type list
```

To find out more about a specific data type, you can use `data-type explain`:

```
uv run kiara data-type explain table
```

Reading this, and following some of the links included. shows us that we can retrieve the table data as a Pandas dataframe using the `to_pandas()` method. 
As the documentation states, this loads the whole data into memory, which is something we should try to avoid, but in a lot of cases 
(esp. if we are dealing with sub-hundreds-of-megabytes-sized data) it's a perfectly acceptable approach. So, let's do this and use our existing knowledge of Pandas, 
and retrieve a list of column names from the table the user provided, print out that information debug-style, using print:

```python
def process(self, inputs, outputs) -> None:

    table_obj = inputs.get_value_obj("table_input")

    print(f"Filter module, table input value: {table_obj}")
    print(f"Table data instance: {table_obj.data}")

    pandas_df = table_obj.data.to_pandas()
    print(f"Column names: {pandas_df.columns}")

    outputs.set_value("table_output", table_obj)
```

Again, let's run and see what's what (this time suppressing the result output we don't need right now, using `--output silent`):

```
uv run kiara run --output silent filter.table table_input=alias:journal_nodes_table
```

Ok, now we filter. Initially, let's say our module accepts only tables that contain a 'City' column, and returns all rows that have 'Berlin' as a value there:

```python
def process(self, inputs, outputs) -> None:

    from kiara.exceptions import KiaraProcessingException

    table_obj = inputs.get_value_obj("table_input")
    pandas_df = table_obj.data.to_pandas()

    column_names = pandas_df.columns
    if "City" not in column_names:
        raise KiaraProcessingException("Invalid table, does not contain a column named 'City'.")

    berlin_df = pandas_df.loc[pandas_df['City'] == "Berlin"]
    outputs.set_value("table_output", berlin_df)
```

And again, we run our module using our example dataset, and now we actually get something that is filtered:

```
uv run kiara run filter.table table_input=alias:journal_nodes_table
```

Of course, a module like this is only of very limited value, because the tables it accepts as inputs must contain a column named 'City', and it only filters out a 
hardcoded string. Ideally, we'd want the user to provide both inputs, along with the table to filter. Let's add those module inputs, and adjust the processing method accordingly:

```python
    def create_inputs_schema(self):
        return {
            "table_input": {
                "type": "table",
                "doc": "The table to filter."
            },
            "column_name": {
                "type": "string",
                "doc": "The column containing the element to use as filter.",
                "default": "City"
            },
            "filter_string": {
                "type": "string",
                "doc": "The string to use as filter."
            }
        }

    def process(self, inputs, outputs) -> None:

        from kiara.exceptions import KiaraProcessingException

        table_obj = inputs.get_value_obj("table_input")
        column_name = inputs.get_value_data("column_name")
        filter_string = inputs.get_value_data("filter_string")

        pandas_df = table_obj.data.to_pandas()

        column_names = pandas_df.columns
        if column_name not in column_names:
            raise KiaraProcessingException(f"Invalid table, does not contain a column named '{column_name}'. Available column names: {', '.join(column_names)}.")

        berlin_df = pandas_df.loc[pandas_df[column_name] == filter_string]
        outputs.set_value("table_output", berlin_df)
```

In this example, I've used a default value for the `column_name` input ('City'). This probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it shows how to set defaults for input fields, 
which in a lot of cases does make sense. We can try to run this command using a missing `filter_string` argument, which shows off nicely what the kiara command-line 
interface has to say about something like this:

```
uv run kiara run filter.table table_input=alias:journal_nodes_table
```

As you can see, kiara complains about the missing input, but has used 'City' as default for the missing `column_name` input, and therefor is ok with the user not providing this. 
Ok, one more time, let's look for 'Amsterdam':

```
uv run kiara run filter.table table_input=alias:journal_nodes_table filter_string=Amsterdam
```

This should give you a good basis to work on your own kiara module(s). Stay tuned for part II of this tutorial!
